# Project Checkpoint

The checkpoint exists is to give you a deadline approximately halfway through
the project. The following are suggestions for information to include in your
checkpoint write-up. Your goal in the writeup is to assure the course staff (and
yourself) that your project is proceeding as you said it would in your proposal.
If it is not, your checkpoint writeup should emphasize what has been causing you
problems, and provide an adjusted schedule and adjusted goals. As projects
differ, not all items in the list below are relevant to all projects.

- Make sure your project schedule on your main project page is up to date with
  work completed so far, and well as with a revised plan of work for the coming
  weeks. As by this time you should have a good understanding of what is
  required to complete your project, I want to see a very detailed schedule for
  the coming weeks. I suggest breaking time down into half-week increments. Each
  increment should have at least one task, and for each task put a person's name
  on it.
- One to two paragraphs, summarize the work that you have completed so far.
  (This should be easy if you have been maintaining this information on your
  project page.)
- Describe how you are doing with respect to the goals and deliverables stated
  in your proposal. Do you still believe you will be able to produce all your
  deliverables? If not, why? What about the "nice to haves"? In your checkpoint
  writeup we want a new list of goals that you plan to hit for the Parallelism
  competition.
- What do you plan to show at the parallelism competition? Will it be a demo?
  Will it be a graph?
- Do you have preliminary results at this time? If so, it would be great to
  included them in your checkpoint write-up.
- List the issues that concern you the most. Are there any remaining unknowns
  (things you simply don't know how to solve, or resource you don't know how to
  get) or is it just a matter of coding and doing the work? If you do not wish
  to put this information on a public web site you are welcome to email the
  staff directly.
- [Optionally] schedule a meeting with the course staff to discuss progress
